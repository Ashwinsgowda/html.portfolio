<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I’m Ashwin S Gowda and I'm on an exciting journey into web development, currently learning from Angela Yu’s Udemy course.
   I’ve already built my first project using HTML—a simple but meaningful start that fuels my passion for creating
    engaging and functional websites..

</p>

<p>Beyond coding, I’m also deeply into fitness. Just like in tech, I believe progress comes from consistency, discipline, and pushing limits. Whether it's optimizing code or lifting heavier weights, I thrive on setting goals and crushing them..</p>

<p>With an open mind and a drive to improve, I’m constantly exploring new technologies and opportunities. I believe success is built on both knowledge and strong relationships, and I’m always looking to collaborate, exchange ideas, and grow together..</p>
